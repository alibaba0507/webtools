MILWAUKEE – President Donald Trump addressed thousands at the UWM Panther Arena in Milwaukee Tuesday night.
In his speech, which lasted more than an hour, Trump talked about his accomplishments while in office, focusing on foreign policy, the economy and appointing federal judges.
“For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America,” he said. “Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for you, the people of Wisconsin.”
On foreign policy, Trump and other members of the Republican Party who spoke focused on the killing of Iranian leader Qassem Soleimani and the democratic response.
“Soleimani was a terrorist and President Trump was right to take him down,” said Vice President Mike Pence during his address.
The airstrike has received sharp criticism from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers.
Trump says Iran’s ‘retaliatory’ attack on U.S. bases in Iraq after Suleimani’s killing were planned before he was killed. He defends the airstrike. He then transitions to the wall on the southern border and insists Mexico will pay for it. #News3Now

People at the rally said they love the president’s record on national security and the economy.
“If you take the emotion out of politics, which is difficult, and you just take a look at where we are with the economy, Trump should be winning in a landslide,” said Jim VanLieshout, a retired banker from Jefferson who went to the rally.
Trump says Wisconsin has reached its lowest unemployment rate, which isn’t true now. Lowest of 2019 was in April (2.8%). In fact, state Republicans just alluded blame of a rising rate (to 3.3%) to Evers when they invited him to the State of the State in December. #News3Now

Trump said the state of Wisconsin has record low unemployment, which was true during his presidency. In April 2019 Wisconsin hit a record low of 2.8 percent unemployment. The last measurement available shows unemployment around 3.3 percent in December 2019.
Trump claims median household incomes have raised $10,000 since he took office, which there is no data to support from what I can find. From the U.S. Census Bureau: “Real median household income in the United States increased 0.8% to $61,937 between 2017 and 2018.” #News3Now

Trump incorrectly stated the median household income has raised $10,000 during his time in office. The U.S. Census Bureau said median household income increased 0.8 percent from 2017 to 2018 to $61,937.
Trump says his call with Ukraine’s president was perfect, then says LBJ was a tough guy. “Lyndon Johnson is probably looking down, well he’s probably looking up…” This was about two sentences after he was talking about keeping respect for the office of the presidency. #News3Now

This was the president’s first stop in Wisconsin during the 2020 campaign year, and his supporters hope he comes back.
“He learned his lesson from 2016, Hillary,” VanLieshout said. “You ignore Wisconsin you may be getting beat, so I don’t think Donald Trump is going to ignore Wisconsin at all.”
