The views expressed here are solely of the bylined autho Environmental groups begged Democrats to block Donald Trump’s disastrous trade deal — but Bernie was the only leading Democratic candidate to stand with them. As he fought Trump’s trade deal — which passed today — Bernie lauded Sens. Kamala Harris and Chuck Schumer for joining him in the fight. Now that the deal has been sent to Trump’s desk, it illustrates a key contrast in the presidential race, with less than 3 weeks until the Iowa caucuses. Here are some things to remember: • TRUMP’S TRADE DEAL WILL MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE WORSE: Major environmental groups begged Democrats to oppose Trump’s trade deal. In a letter to lawmakers, the groups noted that the trade agreement “does not even mention climate change, fails to adequately address toxic pollution, includes weak environmental standards and an even weaker enforcement mechanism, supports fossil fuels, and allows oil and gas corporations to challenge climate and environmental protections." • BERNIE HAS LED THE FIGHT TO STOP TRUMP’S DEAL: While almost every other Democratic presidential candidate touted their support for Trump’s trade deal — and while some of them cast votes for it on the Senate floor — Bernie had the toughness, judgment and courage to oppose it from the beginning. As U.S. News reported, Bernie was “the only candidate on the debate stage Tuesday night to take a stand against President Donald Trump's legislative effort.” By contrast, Joe Biden publicly boosted the trade deal, despite environmental groups begging Democrats to help stop it. • CLIMATE IS A TOP POLLING ISSUE IN IOWA: Bernie being the only leading 2020 Democrat to oppose Trump’s trade deal positions him to make a powerful climate change argument in Iowa — where polls have shown climate is one of the top-polling concerns among Democratic voters. • TRUMP PARTICULARLY FEARS BERNIE BECAUSE BERNIE HAS FOUGHT BAD TRADE DEALS: The Daily Beast this week reported that Trump has become obsessed with Bernie’s rising poll numbers, and he specifically fears Bernie in the industrial states that have been decimated by corporate-written trade deals. Bernie didn’t just oppose Trump’s new trade deal — he has fought deals like NAFTA and the China trade agreement, which candidates like Joe Biden voted for. Bloomberg News previously reported that Biden’s electability argument is undercut by his “decades-long record of backing free-trade deals that have helped hollow out the manufacturing core in several important electoral states.” Bern after reading, Sirota 30 Sign up to like post Subscribe LoginPrivacyTerms BERN NOTICE: Bernie Only 2020 Dem To Vote Against Trump's Trade Deal Environmental groups begged Democrats to oppose the deal -- Bernie was the only leading 2020 Democrat to try to stop it David Sirota Jan 16 30 Sign up to like post Subscribe LoginPrivacyTerms Share ← PreviousNext → Ready for more?

(Jan 9-12, 2020, MM, n=494, +/- 4.4%). This is an eight point bump for Biden from the FAU September poll that had him at 34%, Sanders saw his vote tick up 2 points from 14% but it is Warren who lost the most support going from 24% in September to 10% in the January poll. A majority of Democratic primary voters, 54%, said they will definitely vote for their top choice with 46% saying there is a chance they could change their minds and vote for someone else. Overall, President Trump continues to enjoy a positive approval in the Sunshine state at 45% and 43% disapproval. He continues to be very popular in the GOP with a 66 percentage point lead in a potential primary against two Republican rivals, Trump garners 80% of the vote (n=488, +/-4.4 %). Florida looks to be competitive in 2020 with the four top Democratic rivals either tied of leading against President Trump in potential head to head general election match ups, a flip from the September poll where Trump has small leads over his rivals. Overall, voters are split if Trump should be removed from office with 51% saying he should be removed while 49% say he should be removed. Voters are also split about their Congress person voting to impeach the President with 40% saying it will make them less likely to support the candidate with 38% saying they were more likely to support and 21% had no effect. Sixty-one percent (61%) of voters do not think the US is going to get into a war with Iran while 39% think we will go to war. Governor Ron DeSantis who has just completed his first year in office is popular with 48% approval and 28% disapproval, 25% of voters were neutral or had no opinion. This is similar to his February 2020 approval of 48% and disapproval of 19%. Methodology Data was collected January 9-12, 2020 via a mix mode sample with an online panel provided by Dynata (n=432) and a landline sample provided by Aristotle Inc. and collected by IVR (n=853) for a total sample size of n=1,285, +/-2.6%. Data was weighted based on gender, age, education, and ethnicity based on 2016 voter modeling.
